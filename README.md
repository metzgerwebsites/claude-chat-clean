## What is chat-clean

chat-clean is a **Claude Code mod**. It changes how the chat looks, not what Claude does.

Claude Code shows every tool call it makes: each command, each file read, each diff. On a long task that buries the conversation. chat-clean keeps your messages and Claude's replies, and folds the work of each turn into one line you can open.

It runs in the terminal and in the Claude Code desktop app. It is free, open source and MIT licensed.

### Helpers at a glance

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/helpers-running.png" alt="Helpers launched together: one line above the input with the total, done and running counts, then one line per kind" width="80%" />
</p>

Helpers (subagents) launched together show as one line above the input: the total, how many are done or running, and the time. Below it, one line per kind.

## Quick start

You need Claude Code 2.1.289 or newer. Check with `claude --version`.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git clone https://github.com/achammah/claude-chat-clean .claude/skills/chat-clean
```

Start Claude Code in that project with `claude`. The mod loads by itself. You know it works when the bottom right of the screen reads `feed clean · /feed to switch`.

### Other ways to install

| Way | Commands | When |
|---|---|---|
| **One project** (recommended) | `git clone https://github.com/achammah/claude-chat-clean .claude/skills/chat-clean` | You want it every time you work in this project |
| **Try it once** | `git clone https://github.com/achammah/claude-chat-clean ~/chat-clean`, then `claude --plugin-dir ~/chat-clean` | You want to see it before you keep it |
| **Desktop app** | Install as for one project, then open the project in the app | You use the Claude Code desktop app. If it was already open, type `/reload-plugins` |
| **Every project (marketplace)** | `/plugin marketplace add metzgerwebsites/claude-chat-clean`, then `/plugin install chat-clean@claude-chat-clean` | You want it in all projects. A session that was open before the install needs `/reload-plugins` |

### Update and remove

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/chat-clean
git pull
```

Open sessions reload the mod as soon as its files change. To remove it, delete the folder `.claude/skills/chat-clean`.

Installed from the marketplace: run `claude plugin marketplace update claude-chat-clean`, then `claude plugin update chat-clean@claude-chat-clean`. A session that is open keeps the old version until you type `/reload-plugins` or start it again. To remove it, run `claude plugin uninstall chat-clean@claude-chat-clean`.

## What it does

| Part | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Name column** | `you` beside your messages, `claude` beside the replies, the time of each message at the right edge |
| **Folded turns** | Every tool call of a turn becomes one line, `○ 7 steps this turn ›`. When the turn ends, Claude's text between the steps folds into that line too, so the turn reads as one line and the answer. The arrow opens it in place |
| **One line per row** | With grouping on (`/feed group on`, part of `clean`), each message longer than its row is one line cut with `…`: your messages, slash-command answers, and every Claude answer except the newest turn's. Click anywhere on the line (or its `›`) to open it in place, wrapped and whole. Click `⌄` to cut it again. Works in the fullscreen layout, where Claude Code takes clicks |
| **Working line** | While Claude works: a spinner, the step in plain words (`Reading app.py`), and the time |
| **Helpers** | Helpers launched together show above the input: `3 helpers · 1 done · 2 running · 24s`, one line per kind below |
| **Background runs** | After the turn: `Running in the background · Build the docs · 2m · you can keep typing` |
| **Questions** | Each answered question becomes one line: `? Which colour → Red` |
| **Errors** | One line that says what happened and what to do: `! Connection lost · check your internet · send again to retry` |
| **Slash commands** | The answer is one quiet line under the command |
| **Helper messages** | A helper's report reads as one line (who, state, time, summary), then its first paragraph, formatted. ctrl+o shows all |
| **Safeguard stops** | One line that says the model's safeguards stopped the reply and what to do: edit your message, or switch model |
| **Light mode** | The desktop band switches to pale tints when Claude Code's theme is light |

Labels never show a raw command, a path or an id.

### The three views

| View | What you see |
|---|---|
| `clean` (default) | Your messages, Claude's last reply of each turn, and one line per turn for the work and the text between the steps |
| `normal` | Each run of tool calls is one line with counts: `Ran 3 shell commands · read 1 file` |
| `raw` | Claude Code's own drawing. The mod draws nothing |

- `/feed clean`, `/feed normal` or `/feed raw` switches the view, even while Claude runs.
- `/feed` opens the settings page. Each setting has its own command, for example `/feed group off`.
- `/feed hide <kind>` and `/feed show <kind>` switch one kind of row off or on: `you`, `said`, `tool`, `agent`, `question`, `peer`, `helper`, `search`.
- ctrl+o still shows the full transcript. The view you pick is kept for your next sessions.

## How it works

A Claude Code mod is a plugin folder. Claude Code loads it from `.claude/skills/<name>/` and reloads it when a file changes.

```
chat-clean/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json   the mod's name and version
  hooks/hooks.json             points to the one hooks module
  hooks/register.tsx           the hooks: one per row type it draws
  hooks/feed.ts                plain functions: labels, folding rules, error words
  types/index.d.ts             every value the mod keeps between draws
  tests/                       claude plugin test runs these
```

| Claude Code row | What chat-clean does with it |
|---|---|
| `UserMessage` | Draws the `you` column and the time |
| `AssistantMessage` | Draws the `claude` column; turns an API error into one line |
| `ToolUse`, `ToolGroup`, `ToolResult` | Folds a turn's calls into one line |
| `Spinner` | Draws the working line under the last row |
| `AbovePrompt` | Draws the helper line and the background line above the input |
| `CommandOutput` | Draws a slash command's answer as one line |

Check a change with `claude plugin validate .` and `claude plugin test .`.

### What it cannot hide

Some rows belong to Claude Code itself, and no mod can reach them:

- hook rows, for example "Ran 2 stop hooks";
- the reload line that appears when a mod reloads;
- the attachment lines under a message, for example "Loaded CLAUDE.md";
- the "N background agents launched" block. chat-clean shows helpers above the input instead.

Rows drawn while the mod reloads keep Claude Code's look, because they are already on screen.

With verbose output on (`"verbose": true` or `--verbose`), Claude Code draws every row expanded, so chat-clean cannot tell your view from ctrl+o: steps still fold, and ctrl+o shows them folded too. Open a turn with its `›` line. In the fullscreen layout, ctrl+o draws each call as its own row with nothing that marks it as ctrl+o, so the steps stay folded there as well.

### In the desktop app

- The desktop app keeps its own message bubbles. The name column is for the terminal.
- The desktop app runs no status line, so the band above the input shows your 5-hour and weekly usage, and one pill per running helper, job and test.
